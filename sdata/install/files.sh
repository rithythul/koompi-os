#   sync      - tree owned by this repo; rsync --delete so a file we removed
#               upstream also leaves the user's copy (hypr/hyprland, quickshell)
#   merge     - tree the user shares with us; copy in, never delete
#   keep      - user override slots; written only when absent, never clobbered
#
# Everything written is appended to the manifest so `setup uninstall` removes
# exactly what was added and nothing else.

# Files under dots/.config/hypr/custom are the documented place for personal
# overrides. Shipping them is how the user learns they exist; overwriting them
# on the next update would throw away their config.

# with several gigabytes of identical backups. A file that already matches what
# we are about to write cannot be lost by writing it, so it needs no copy.
